 MAC Address Changer

    Media Access Control
        -permanent
        -physical
        -unique, persistent
        -Assigned by manufacturer

    Why change the MAC
        -increase anonymity
        -impersonate other devices
        -bypass filters

    By default on kali linux the ifconfig tool is pre-installed though utilization
    of ifconfig commands one can manually change the MAC address of any interface
    commands:
        ifconfig -
            view connections including state addresses ect...
        ifconfig <interface> down -
            set the state of specified interface to down in order to change
        ifconfig <interface> hw ether <desired new MAC address> -
            specify the new mac address overwriting the previous address
        ifconfig <interface> up -
            set the state of specified interface back up broadcasting the new MAC
    *note in most cases eth0 will be the default interface within a kali linux vm

    Goal instead of manually changing the MAC create a program to automate this process
    be able to execute system commands to do this utilize subprocess module
        -subprocess module allows for execution of system commands
        works in a variety of operating systems depending on where the script is ran
            documentation for subprocess module
                DEPRECATED https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html
                PYTHON 3 https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html
            basic use:  subprocess.call("ifconfig", shell=True)
    be able to dynamically specify new mac and target interface
        -handle user input using the input() function at first and later using cli arguments
            in regards to input() in python2 its writen as rawinput() in python3
        -argparse module for cli arguments passed by user
            documentation for argparse
                PYTHON 3 https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html
        -regex to locate patterns in cli entry in this case to identify a mac address

    simple algorithm
        goal-check if mac address was changed
            read and execute ifconfig
            read mac address from output
            check if mac in ifconfig was changed correctly
            print verification
